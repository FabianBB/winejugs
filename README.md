Two men have a 8-gallon jug full of wine and two empty jugs with a capacity of
5 and 3 gallons. They want to divide the wine into two equal parts. Suppose that when shifting
wine from one jug to another, in order to know how much they have transferred, the men must
always empty out the first jug or fill the second one (or both). Formulate this problem as a
reachability problem in an appropriately defined graph.

basecase.py solves the case described above (i.e. where capacities are 8,5,3 and target is 4,4,0)

generalcase.py solves the general case where initial volume, capacities and target state can be defined by user input
